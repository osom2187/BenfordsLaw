# BenfordsLaw
This was a little experiment on a collection of numbers of population sizes which came up during the International and European Studies Winter School of the University of Tuebingen. 
The code is simply the fastest way I could come up with to sort the numbers to find out how close to Benford's Law the distribution would fall. 
I might add some visualization or shorten the code later on.
